In recent years, the Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) has been increasingly adopted to manage risks in the supply
chain, and the Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) is one of the main SBoM specifications, created to ensure that users
comply with licenses. On the other hand, it is important to understand the dependencies in order to comply with the license.
Currently, however, there are no tools that automatically generate SPDX files including dependencies. Therefore, we developed
a tool to automatically generate SPDX files including dependency descriptions for Debian packages. As a result, we succeeded
in generating SPDX files that include dependency descriptions and satisfy the SPDX requirements. This paper describes the
method and results of the generation.
